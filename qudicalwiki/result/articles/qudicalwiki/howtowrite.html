This means that you are definitely encouraged to document <i>everything!</i> There are a few things you should keep in mind though:<br><h3>1. Anyone can read this!</h3>Don't forget: The Wiki is public! There is no form of authentication, so anything you write on this site can be viewed by <i>literally anyone.</i> This means that you shouldn't write anything you don't want to spoil!<br><b>Just keep in mind to not say anything about the game itself, just the tech.</b> <br>For example: On the Wiki, the description for <a href="/qudicalwiki/categories/DSa1984.html">DSa1984's</a> category doesn't say anything about the game's story, just its gameplay and technology! Try to do something similiar when writing articles.<br><h3>2. Again: Anyone can read this!</h3>This includes people who literally don't know <i>anything</i> about the game's technology yet. This means that, in general, you should try to reference unexplained concepts as little as possible, like saying that /qudicalwiki/categories/DSa1984.htmlDSa1984's modkit outputs 'Conversation Files' without actually explaining what those are.<br>Now, this doesn't mean that you should give a definition for every little word in your article. Just try to at least link to another page explaining the concept, <i>even if that page does not exist yet.</i> You can then make a page for it later, or someone else will see that no page exists for it yet, and they will make it themselves.<br><h3>3. Keep things formal and concise.</h3>Don't forget: The Wiki is meant to be used as a quick reference while developing. This means that <b>all the necessary and important info should be easy to find.</b> For example, if you're making an article about a door object, try to put all the settings for the door at the top of the page, so that anyone placing that door down can go to your article and <i>immediately</i> see the possible settings they can use.<br><br><h2>QWI Header</h2>QWI, which stands for Qudical Wiki Info, is a way or storing properties about a certain object. In the case of an article, QWI is used in its header to give information about the page and its categories.<br>The way QWI works is very simple. On the first line, the name of a property name is given, and on the next line its value is given. Then the next line is another property name, etc. For example:<br><div class="codeblock"><code>PropertyName<br>This is where the value of that PropertyName goes.<br>AnotherProperty<br>This is the value of AnotherProperty!</code></div><br><br>In the header, the following properties are available:<br><code>Title</code> - The title that shows up as a link in the category pages and in the tab name. <b><i>Note:</b> This does not actually put a title in the article itself. You will have to do that yourself.</i><br><br><code>Category</code> - The category that the page belongs in. Be sure to spell this correctly! <b><i>Note:</b> You can input any name, and the category for it will be automatically created if it doesn't already exist yet.</i><br><br><code>Section</code> - A 'sub-category' that the page belongs in. Be sure to spell this correctly! <b><i>Note:</b> Again, you can input any name, everything is handled automatically.</i><br><br><code>CategoryDescription</code> - A description for the category the page belongs to. <b>This is optional and should only be used once for every category!</b> So don't define this property in <i>every</i> article, only in <i>one</i> article in every category. If multiple category descriptions for one category are detected, the Generator will give a warning and refuse to accept any more descriptions for that category.<br><br>For example, here's the QWI Header for this page as of writing:<br><div class="codeblock"><code>Title<br>Writing an article for the Qudical Developer Wiki<br>Category<br>Qudical Wiki<br>Section<br>Qudical Wiki<br>CategoryDescription<br>Info about the Qudical Developer Wiki itself and its generator.<br>==</code></div><br>The <code>==</code> at the end signifies the end of the header, and after that the actual article may be written. <b>Remember to use the <code>==</code> to seperate the header with the article or the page will be parsed incorrectly!</b><br><br><h2>Writing the actual article</h2>To actually write an article, you should first create a <code>.qwa</code> file (which is actually just a text with a different file extension) in the <code>[project_directory]/articles</code> folder. It can be in any subfolder and can have any name, they don't have any effect on the outside, they're just for organization while writing the wiki. <br><b><i>Note:</b> When the site is generated the <code>.qwa</code> files are translated into <code>.html</code> files, and they will end up in the same folder structure in the generated site. Keep that in mind when creatings links.</i><br><br>In the article file, a QWI header must first be put in. After that, the actual article may be written. To write an article, the special /qudicalwiki/articles/qudicalwiki/marklanguage.htmlQudical Wiki markup language should be used, which is out of the scope of this article.<br>When a valid <code>.qwa</code> file has been made, and has been put somewhere withing the <code>articles</code> folder, the Wiki Generator will automatically generate a page for it and will link it with the categories and sections that you've set.</p>    </div>    <div class="footer">        <p>Qudical Games 2020 - <a href="https://github.com/Qudical/qudicalwiki">View on github</a> - Generated using the Qudical Wiki Generator 1.0.0.0</p>    </div></body></html>
