# The Qudical Developer Wiki

This is the Qudical Developer Wiki, which serves as reference material to anyone part of the Qudical Games group.
The Wiki uses a custom static site generator written in C#, which turns a bunch of articles, written in modified version of markdown, into a static website meant to be used with Github Pages!

Feel free to use the generator to create your own wikis! Check the actual wiki itself for information on how it actually all works.
