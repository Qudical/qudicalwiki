If you are in one of those spaces, please read this!</p>
<h1>The Qudical Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>This Code of Conduct shows what I want my communities to be like. I value kindness and diversity, a safe space for everyone, and I will not accept harassment, intolerance and disrespect. If any of these norms and values are against yours, you are simply unwanted.
Participating in any of these communities means you declare you have read and understand this Code of Conduct. 'I didn't read this' is not a valid excuse for violations!</p>
<h3>Application</h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to any online communities or events managed or organized by members of the Qudical team and whoever else would like to make use of it.</p>
<h3>Expectations</h3>
<p>Remember the Platinum Rule: <strong>Treat people the way <em>they</em> want to be treated!</strong></p>
<p>In our communities you are required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be kind to others! Don't be rude, but also don't be afraid to speak up if something's wrong!</li>
<li>Respect people's opinions and identities!</li>
<li>Give feedback, create discussions, but remember to keep criticism constructive! Always accept constructive criticism gracefully.</li>
<li>Be mindful of others! Just because <em>you're</em> fine with something doesn't mean everyone else is.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>Violating any of these rules will result in a warning, and repeated offenses may result in a ban. In some cases it is also allowed to immediately ban someone depending on the severity of the violation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insulting, harassment and discrimination are absolutely unacceptable, no matter whether it's public or private. Our priority is to create a safe environment for everyone regardless of origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disabilities, appearances or any other similar characteristics. <em>Especially</em> for minorities.</li>
<li>Being aggresive or offensive, such as attacking minorities or mocking people's sexual orientation, gender or pronouns is not acceptable.</li>
<li>Leaking private information, such as an address or phone number, without permission is unacceptable. (This is often also called 'doxing.')</li>
<li>Attention-seeking behavior such as trolling or spamming is unacceptable.</li>
<li>Going after and trying to stop people reporting behavior against this Code of Conduct is unacceptable, no matter the validity of the complaint.</li>
<li>Any other behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropiate in a professional setting is deemed unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reporting violations</h3>
<p>If you see or are involved with what you think is a violation of this Code of Conduct, please send a report in an email to <a href="mailto:qudicalgames@gmail.com">qudicalgames@gmail.com</a>, or you may send a report directly to a community moderator, or anyone else on the Qudical team.
Don't be afraid of contacting us. Your safety is our priority, and trying to stop someone from reporting a violation of this Code of Conduct is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading! If you have any suggestions to make for changes or additions to this Code of Conduct, feel free to send an email to <a href="mailto:qudicalgames@gmail.com">qudicalgames@gmail.com</a>. Thanks, and have fun.</p>
