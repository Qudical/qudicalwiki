This means that you are definitely encouraged to document <em>everything!</em> There are a few things you should keep in mind though:<br>### 1. Anyone can read this!<br>Don't forget: The Wiki is public! There is no form of authentication, so anything you write on this site can be viewed by <em>literally anyone.</em> This means that you shouldn't write anything you don't want to spoil!<br><strong>Just keep in mind to not say anything about the game itself, just the tech.</strong> <br>For example: On the Wiki, the description for <a href="/qudicalwiki/categories/DSa1984.html">DSa1984's</a> category doesn't say anything about the game's story, just its gameplay and technology! Try to do something similiar when writing articles.<br>### 2. Again: Anyone can read this!<br>This includes people who literally don't know <em>anything</em> about the game's technology yet. This means that, in general, you should try to reference unexplained concepts as little as possible, like saying that <a href="/qudicalwiki/categories/DSa1984.html">DSa1984's</a> modkit outputs 'Conversation Files' without actually explaining what those are.<br>Now, this doesn't mean that you should give a definition for every little word in your article. Just try to at least link to another page explaining the concept, <em>even if that page does not exist yet.</em> You can then make a page for it later, or someone else will see that no page exists for it yet, and they will make it themselves.<br>### 3. Keep things formal and concise.<br>Don't forget: The Wiki is meant to be used as a quick reference while developing. This means that <strong>all the necessary and important info should be easy to find.</strong> For example, if you're making an article about a door object, try to put all the settings for the door at the top of the page, so that anyone placing that door down can go to your article and <em>immediately</em> see the possible settings they can use.<br><br>## QWI Header<br>QWI, which stands for Qudical Wiki Info, is a way or storing properties about a certain object. In the case of an article, QWI is used in its header to give information about the page and its categories.<br>The way QWI works is very simple. On the first line, the name of a property name is given, and on the next line its value is given. Then the next line is another property name, etc. For example:<br><code>&lt;br&gt;PropertyName&lt;br&gt;This is where the value of that PropertyName goes.&lt;br&gt;AnotherProperty&lt;br&gt;This is the value of AnotherProperty!&lt;br&gt;</code><br><br>In the header, the following properties are available:<br><code>Title</code> - The title that shows up as a link in the category pages and in the tab name. <strong>_Note:</strong> This does not actually put a title in the article itself. You will have to do that yourself.<em><br><br><code>Category</code> - The category that the page belongs in. Be sure to spell this correctly! <strong>_Note:</strong> You can input any name, and the category for it will be automatically created if it doesn't already exist yet.</em><br><br><code>Section</code> - A 'sub-category' that the page belongs in. Be sure to spell this correctly! <strong>_Note:</strong> Again, you can input any name, everything is handled automatically.<em><br><br><code>CategoryDescription</code> - A description for the category the page belongs to. <strong>This is optional and should only be used once for every category!</strong> So don't define this property in <em>every</em> article, only in <em>one</em> article in every category. If multiple category descriptions for one category are detected, the Generator will give a warning and refuse to accept any more descriptions for that category.<br><br>For example, here's the QWI Header for this page as of writing:<br><code>&lt;br&gt;Title&lt;br&gt;Writing an article for the Qudical Developer Wiki&lt;br&gt;Category&lt;br&gt;Qudical Wiki&lt;br&gt;Section&lt;br&gt;Qudical Wiki&lt;br&gt;CategoryDescription&lt;br&gt;Info about the Qudical Developer Wiki itself and its generator.&lt;br&gt;</code><br>The <code>==</code> at the end signifies the end of the header, and after that the actual article may be written. <strong>Remember to use the <code>==</code> to seperate the header with the article or the page will be parsed incorrectly!</strong><br><br>## Writing the actual article<br>To actually write an article, you should first create a <code>.qwa</code> file (which is actually just a text with a different file extension) in the <code>[project\_directory]/articles</code> folder. It can be in any subfolder and can have any name, they don't have any effect on the outside, they're just for organization while writing the wiki. <br><strong>_Note:</strong> When the site is generated the <code>.qwa</code> files are translated into <code>.html</code> files, and they will end up in the same folder structure in the generated site. Keep that in mind when creatings links.</em><br><br>In the article file, a QWI header must first be put in. After that, the actual article may be written. To write an article, the special &amp;/qudicalwiki/articles/qudicalwiki/marklanguage.html&amp;Qudical Wiki markup language&amp; should be used, which is out of the scope of this article.<br>When a valid <code>.qwa</code> file has been made, and has been put somewhere withing the <code>articles</code> folder, the Wiki Generator will automatically generate a page for it and will link it with the categories and sections that you've set.</h1>
