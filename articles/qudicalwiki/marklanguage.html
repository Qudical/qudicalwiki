Instead, you're supposed to use the special markup language that the Qudical Wiki uses. It is based on Markdown, but it has a few differences because of the way the Qudical Wiki Generator parses these files. The way it works is that you simply surround a piece of text with a certain symbol, and that will be automatically converted into an html counter part. <b><i>Note:</b> Yes, this means that you can put in raw html into an article and it will work in the final site. This is not recommended though, and if you need some kind of custom new feature, it is advised to instead make it a part of the markup language and let the Generator take care of it.</i><br>If you want to write a symbol that's used as a tag (for example you want to write something with an underscore, but you don't want it to turn stuff into italics) you can put a backslash (\) in front of it, and that will cancel the tag out.<br><h2>The tags</h2><h3>Bold</h3><div class="codeblock"><code>**Two asterixes can be used to make a text bold.** However, __two underscores can also be used to make a text bold.__</code></div><br><b>Two asterixes can be used to make a text bold.</b> However, <b>two underscores can also be used to make a text bold.</b><br><h3>Italics</h3><div class="codeblock"><code>*One asterix can be used to turn a text into italics.* However, _one underscore will also do the trick._</code></div><br><i>One asterix can be used to turn a text into italics.</i> However, <i>one underscore will also do the trick.</i><br><h3>Code</h3><div class="codeblock"><code>`This backtick (usually found right below your escape key) will make the text use a monospace font, typically used for showing an inline piece of code or technical term.`</code></div><br><code>This back-tick (usually found right below your escape key) will make the text use a monospace font, typically used for showing an inline piece of code or technical term.</code><br><h3>Codeblock</h3><div class="codeblock"><code>~This tilde key (usually found on the same key as the backtick) will turn the text into a codeblock, which, similiarly to the normal code tag, will make the text use a monospace font.
